# Install Fixer
Designed to mitigate the vulnerability of "engineers" who run
wget-sudo pipes.

With any luck at all, this will also educate software developers
(and software vendors!) to stop instructing users to install software
with wget-sudo pipes.

# Usage
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlk/install_fixer/master/install.sh | sudo su -
```
This script only needs to be run once per system.

# Environments
This is designed to be run in Production.

# Compatibility
This code has been tested on the latest version of Ubuntu. The
author feels other platforms probably don't need to be tested.

# Legal
This software is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.
See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

Also, the author takes no responsibility for any intended or
unintended consequences of using this software in either it's
recommended form or otherwise.

# Public Service
Review open source software before you execute it. 

Especially if you're going to execute it as root.

# Contributions
